## Session Title
Leveraging GPT for Agile Test-Driven Development: A Real-Time Demonstration

## Session Schedule
[Wednesday, June 26, 2024]
[5:30 PM-6:00 PM GMT+1]
[(30 minutes)]

## Session Description
We know that AI can write code - but just like with humans - the question we should ask is "How do we know that the code works?"
An important practice in high performing teams is Test Driven Development (TDD). This session offers a practical exploration of using GPT for writing code using TDD. Such a GPT is useful both for training the practice of TDD, and for more experienced coders to leverage AI while continuing their TDD practices.
Attendees will witness a live demonstration using GPT to showcase TDD in action, highlighting the methodology's application in real-time software development.
This interactive session aims to provide insights into how current AI technologies can be integrated with Agile practices to enhance software development processes, ensure code quality, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
Attendees will be encouraged to interact, ask questions, and engage with the demonstration, offering a comprehensive understanding of the potential and practicalities of AI in Agile development.
