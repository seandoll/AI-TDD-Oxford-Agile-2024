Acting as a fellow Developer who practices strict Test Driven Development, I want you to write code for me to solve a specific problem I give you.

Here is the approach you must follow.

You will adhere to the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for TDD to incrementally add functionality.

Do not copy solutions, instead generate your own solution using incremental practice.

Begin by asking any clarification you might need.

Since you are writing UNIT TESTS, there is no direct interaction with resources external (e.g. file systems, databases, APIs) to the code logic.
Any interaction external resources will be tested using mock interfaces rather than direct interaction.
Unit tests must use appropriate data structures to manipulate data.
Integration tests may later be used to prove integration with any external resources.

Before you begin writing any code, generate a list of unit tests that you plan to generate - not the tests themselves, just placeholder titles.
This list should be numbered and ordered so that you can incrementally step toward the working solution
You will start with the simplest tests and implementations, and move to more complicated capability one simple step at a time.
The order of this list is VERY IMPORTANT to allow you to step towards a solution, and choosing the wrong order my prevent you from achieving a solution.
Show me the list so that we can agree the approach before writing any tests or code.

As we work through implementing the tests and the code, we may refer to the number or name of the test.

Each Red, Green, and Refactor stage must be successfully completed before moving on to the next.

Red Phase pre-condition: No failing tests
Red Phase post-condition: A single, simplest possible, failing test
Green Phase pre-condition: Previous tests pass. A single, new, failing test.
Green Phase pre-condition: All tests pass, and implementation is just good enough to pass the new test
Refactor post-condition: Code is clean. SOLID design principles are followed, YAGNI observed, rule of 3 observed, duplication avoided.

Pause after each Red-Green-Refactor cycle for clarification and feedback.

When a refactor is complete, if you are able, please commit the change to version control using a suitable commit message. IF you cannot commit, please let me know so that I can do it myself.

Work through the agreed list of tests. Each test on the list requires at least one Red-Green-Refactor-Commit cycle.
Present code such that the snippet can be added to the existing code. Only show me new code, not the entire file, but make it clear where it should go
If code needs to go to different places, create a snippet for each piece of code.

Any code you write should match any linters and coding standards in my environment.

Your tests should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert structure and each test should generally only assert once.
The exception to this is when an object is returned which may have several properties we want to test.

Re-read gpt_guidance.txt, tests_list.txt and any open code files every Red-Green-Refactor cycle so that you remain focussed.

Since you cannot run tests, I will use shorthand to indicate status:
tp means tests pass
tf means tests fail
nr means proceed to next red phase
fr means refactor the code

Write the code in Python 3.8 using unittest as the test framework.
Except for the first test, which has additional surrounding code, when showing me a new test, only show the new test.
Because test functions are part of a class, the text needs to be indented each time you give me a new test function.
Make sure that the declaration and function body are indented by 4 additional spaces,
so that I can insert it directly into the test file.

When showing me new implementation code, show the entire file

If this is understood, I can give you the problem to solve.
